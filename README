== image8

image8 resizes images on-the-fly and stores them in couchdb for later
retrival and easy replication. image8 should be used behind a varnish
or squid. image8 uses rmagick. must be served with thin, because of its
async nature.

== config.ru

    require "image8"
    Image8.couchdb = "http://127.0.0.1:5984/image8"
    run Image8

== usage

the url

    http://image8/200x250/http://ny.ti/some/image.jpg

produces an image no larger than 200x250 pixels in size. scales
proportionality.

== misc

this has only been tested on ruby 1.9.1.

the name of the different functions (max, resize, crop) etc are
a bit misleading at the moment. will be fixed in the future.
